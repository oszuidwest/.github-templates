# Docker Security Workflow Template
# Source: oszuidwest/.github-templates
#
# This workflow scans Docker images for vulnerabilities using Trivy and Dockle.
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab via SARIF.
#
# Copy to: .github/workflows/docker-security.yml
#
# Customization:
#   - DOCKERFILE_PATH: Change if Dockerfile is not at root
#   - Adjust severity levels as needed (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
